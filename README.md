# k-nearest-neighbor
This repository contains an implementation and visualisation of the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm

## Features

1. **Implementing Euclidean Distance**: The repository includes code to compute the Euclidean distance between data points. Euclidean distance is a commonly used metric in KNN to measure the similarity between two points in a multidimensional space.

2. **Implementing K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: The core of the repository is the implementation of the KNN algorithm. This algorithm finds the K nearest neighbors to a given data point.

3. **Determining Class for New Data Points**: With the implemented KNN algorithm, you can determine the class for new data points by considering the labels of their nearest neighbors.

4. **Visualization**: Additionally, this repository finds and visualizes class boundaries.

## Usage

To use the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main script to see the algorithm in action.
4. Experiment with different datasets and parameters to explore the algorithm's behavior.
